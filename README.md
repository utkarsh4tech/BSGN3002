# BSGN3002 - Financial Forencics

Project for course BSGN3002 - Financial Forencics. Our team id was "TEAM 5".

Parthasarathy Subburaj (Course Instructor) told us our team had 112% gain and was best performing on the "T3" dataset (which is hidden from us) with respect to price per share score. Our methodology was simple yet quite efficient. This was a real time dataset, hence we enjoyed a lot.
